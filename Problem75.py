It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle
in exactly one way, but there are many more examples.

12 cm: (3,4,5)
24 cm: (6,8,10)
30 cm: (5,12,13)
36 cm: (9,12,15)
40 cm: (8,15,17)
48 cm: (12,16,20)

In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle,
and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form 
exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.

120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)

Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L â‰¤ 1,500,000 
can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?

        # belong to exactly one pythagorean triple a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
        # from wikipedia, Euclid's formula offers a way of generating pythagorean triples:
        # a = m^2 - n^2; b = 2mn; c = m^2 + n^2 for arbitrary integers m > n > 0

        # of coprime numbers m, n, one of which is even." This means that we should be able to easily generate all
        # of the primitive triples for c <= 1,500,000 and then the non primitive ones can be easily filled in by
